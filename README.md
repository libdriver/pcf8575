## LibDriver PCF8575

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/pcf8575/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

This 16-bit I/O expander for the two-line bidirectional bus (I2C) is designed for 2.5V to 5.5V VCC operation.The PCF8575 device provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion for most microcontroller families by way of the I2C interface [serial clock (SCL), serial data (SDA)].The device features a 16-bit quasi-bidirectional input/output (I/O) port (P07–P00, P17–P10), including latched outputs with high-current drive capability for directly driving LEDs. Each quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a data-direction control signal. At power on, the I/Os are high. In this mode, only a current source to VCC is active.

LibDriver PCF8575 is a full-featured driver of PCF8575 launched by LibDriver.It provides I/O writing, I/O reading and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_pcf8575_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
pcf8575_pin_level_t level;

/* basic init */
res = pcf8575_basic_init(PCF8575_ADDRESS_A000);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

/* read pin */
res = pcf8575_basic_read(PCF8575_PIN_00, (pcf8575_pin_level_t *)&level);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)pcf8575_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

/* write pin */
res = pcf8575_basic_write(PCF8575_PIN_00, PCF8575_PIN_LEVEL_HIGH);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)pcf8575_basic_deinit();

    return 1;
}

...

(void)pcf8575_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
